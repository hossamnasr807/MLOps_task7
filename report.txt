### **2. Historical Context**  
The roots of computer science trace back to the 19th century, but its formalization began in the 20th century. Key milestones include:  
- **1930s–1940s**: Alan Turing proposed the concept of the "Turing Machine" (1936), laying the groundwork for computational theory. Ada Lovelace (1842) is credited with writing the first algorithmic program for a mechanical computer.  
- **1940s–1950s**: The development of the first electronic computers (e.g., ENIAC) and the advent of programming languages (e.g., Fortran in 1957) marked the birth of modern computing.  
- **1950s–1960s**: John von Neumann’s architecture (1945) standardized computer design, while the creation of the first operating systems (e.g., Unix) enabled software development.  
- **1960s–1970s**: The rise of personal computers (PCs) and the development of programming languages like C and Pascal revolutionized accessibility.  
- **1980s–1990s**: The internet (1983) and the proliferation of software (e.g., Windows, Linux) transformed global communication and collaboration.  
- **2000s–Present**: The emergence of cloud computing, mobile devices, and AI (e.g., neural networks) has expanded the scope of CS, driven by advancements in hardware and software.
